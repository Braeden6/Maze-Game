## Maze Search Game Description

This game will consist of a normally drawn maze that you must navigate through to the end. The maze will not be 
fully visable. Your person or character will only be able to around him in a *Fog of War* type vision. You will have
go through the maze dogging traps and find items that are required to exit.

This application will be designed to be fun to play. Someone who is bored and needs something to do might download this
game, give it a try, and hopefully have some fun. 

This project interest as I have been interest in programming a mini game like the one described above. I, like many
others, love to play video games and designing a mini version of one will be very interesting to me.


Things this game will hopefully include:
- Items to find and maybe equip
- Traps to set off and dodge
- *Fog of War* vision in which you can only see what the person should be able to see
- A maze to go through
